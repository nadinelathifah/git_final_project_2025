                        <h5><span class="material-symbols-outlined">counter_1</span><strong>Set up your profile</strong></h5>
                        <p>Customers are way more likely to book someone with a complete profile. Showcase your skills, certifications & potential — it helps build trust right away.</p>
                        <h5><span class="material-symbols-outlined">counter_2</span><strong>Update your status with an enthusiastic message!</strong></h5>
                        <p>Let customers know you're active and ready to go! A dynamic message shows you're engaged, approachable, and open for business. A little personality goes a long way!</p>
                        <h5><span class="material-symbols-outlined">counter_3</span><strong>Collect reviews from happy customers :)</strong></h5>
                        <p>A couple of five-star reviews can go a long way. After a job well done, kindly ask your client to leave a quick review. It’s one of the best ways to build credibility fast.</p>
                        <h5><span class="material-symbols-outlined">counter_4</span><strong>Respond Quickly to Messages & Booking Requests</strong></h5>
                        <p>Speed matters! The faster you reply, the more likely you are to secure the booking. Even a short “Hi! Thanks for getting in touch, I’ll follow up shortly” shows professionalism.</p>
                        <h5><span class="material-symbols-outlined">counter_5</span><strong>Be Friendly & Professional On the Job</strong></h5>
                        <p>Word of mouth is powerful. Great customer experiences lead to repeat work and referrals — and you never know who they’ll recommend you to next!</p>
                        <h5><span class="material-symbols-outlined">counter_6</span><strong>Keep Learning & Improving</strong></h5>
                        <p>Stay sharp! Whether it’s picking up a new skill, investing in better tools, or improving customer service, small improvements can lead to big growth.</p>
